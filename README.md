# Stovl: An R program for extracting the shap values of ovate tree leaves

# Introduction
`stovl` is an R package for extracting the shap values of ovate tree leavies, including leaf length, width, and radius from center to edge. The width values contain the widths at the one-third part, at the half part and at the two-thirds part as well as the largest one. The radius is taken at every degree from -pi to pi. `stovl` Each leaf must be scanned to generate a bmp file with a fixed resolution.
